## **Introduction**

Welcome to the BLADE Game Development Kit(BGDK) Development Blog.

As a Blog, this is mainly focused to keep documented the development of the GDK using the [Vulkan Graphics API](https://www.vulkan.org/) and the [C++ programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B).

For the moment, the development of the BGDK will focus on the Graphics side for 2D games and applications development.
The first features to be developed will follow this list bellow:

```
1  Create project generation script
2  Window managment and resizing
3  Graphics card selection
4  Drawing static images
5  Drawing static sprite sheets
6  Drawing animated 2D images
```

The development will be made with the [NVIM text editor](https://neovim.io/) using the linux desktop environment, so most of the topics will be with linux in mind. But with the sucess of the development of the GDK, future implementation builds for other operating systems will be made.
